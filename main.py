# Future ideas:
# dont use random file names but use the data given from tweets
# add logging

# create folders of users and add respective images with different file names there

# what about just creating another script that sorts the image files based on their prefix (username) in the file
# and the API thingy just puts all images into one folders where you can check all the images
# once you delete all of the ones that you dont want to have in your collection
# you can execute the script and it will sort everything automatically
